                        <p class="news1-text">A Christmas prank was taken to extremes when a man got a little bit carried away with a roll of wrapping paper.

                            Nichola Mullen-King from Newcastle got a shock when she returned home on Monday and walked into the kitchen.
                            
                            That's because her husband Carl had covered the entire room in Christmas wrapping paper - including the fruit, chopping board and utensils.

                            The amusing act took him around two hours to complete and it's fair to say Nichola wasn't all that impressed with his work.
                            
                            Sharing snaps of her 'new' kitchen on Facebook , she wrote: "My a******e of a husband came up with the bright idea to wrap part of the kitchen for elf on the shelf...</p>

                    <p class="news2-text">Ranger the German Shepherd is two-years-old, but you wouldn't be able to tell just by looking at him.

                        That's because the adorable dog has a very rare condition which makes him look like a puppy, despite being an adult.
                    </p>
                    <p class="news2-text">    
                    Ranger, who lives in Phoenix, Arizona, with his guardian Shelby Mayo, was diagnosed with Pituitary Dwarfism after contracting a parasite called Giardia.
                        
                        After recovering, his owners noticed that the pooch wasn't growing at the same rate as other dogs of his breed.
                        
                        So they took him to the vet, where they discovered that he is stuck in perpetual puppy-hood.</p>

                                    On the very same day last week, the Governors of Maine and Vermont both passed legislation to ban single-use plastic bags, making them the fourth and fifth US states to do so.

                                    Gov. Janet Mills (D) signed LD 1532 on Monday, stating that “a retail establishment may not provide a single-use carry-out bag to a customer at the point of sale or otherwise make single-use carry-out bags available to customers.”

                                    The bill will apply to the sale of single-use plastic bags in grocery stores, although supermarkets must charge 5 cents for recyclable paper bags or reusable plastic bags that can withstand at least 75 uses. Restaurants and charities, however, are exempt from the fee.

                    <p class="news2-text">
                        Canada has just passed legislation that bans keeping whales, dolphins, and porpoises in captivity for entertainment, as well as the trade, possession, capture and breeding of cetaceans.

                        Bill S-203, also known as the “Ending the Captivity of Whales and Dolphins Act”, was approved by the House of Commons after they voted overwhelmingly in favor of the bill earlier this week.
                    </p>
                    <p class="news2-text">    
                        The bill was introduced by Senator Wilfred Moore in 2015, and then sponsored by Senator Murray Sinclair. Upon passage through the Senate, it was championed by Green Party Leader Elizabeth May in the House of Commons.

                        “Canadians have been clear, they want the cruel practice of keeping whales and dolphins in captivity to end,” said Green Party Leader MP Elizabeth May. “With the passage of Bill S-203, we have ensured that this will happen.”</p>
